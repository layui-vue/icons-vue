The abstract trees of the layui iconfont icons.

## Get Started

Use npm to install.

```bash
npm i @layui/icons-vue
```
Font icon files need to be introduced before use

```
import "@layui/icons-vue/lib/index.css"
```

Componentization, using the class of iconfont as the component name.

```
<template>
    <AlignCenterIcon></AlignCenterIcon>
    <DiamondIcon></DiamondIcon>
</template>
<script lang="ts" setup>
import { AlignCenterIcon, DiamondIcon } from '@layui/icons-vue';
</script>
```

Traditionally, components are rendered by passing class through type.

```
<template>
  <!-- Âä®ÊÄÅÂõæÊ†á -->
  <LayIcon type="layui-icon-not-found"></LayIcon>
  <LayIcon type="layui-icon-diamond"></LayIcon>
</template>
<script lang="ts" setup>
import { LayIcon } from '@layui/icons-vue';
</script>
```
